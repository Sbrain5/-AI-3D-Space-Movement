# 3D Multiplayer Octree Pathfinding and AI System (Unity)

A fully custom volumetric 3D navigation and AI framework built in Unity using C#.

This system replaces Unity’s NavMesh with a true 3D octree-based pathfinding solution designed for:
1. Large-scale environments
2. Zero-gravity or space-based movement
3. Multiplayer server-authoritative movement
4. Dynamic obstacle-heavy worlds

# Overview

This project demonstrates:
1. Octree-based spatial partitioning
2. Custom A* graph pathfinding
3. Traffic-aware path diversification
4. Server-authoritative multiplayer movement
5. Physics-based movement safety validation
6. Behavior-tree-driven AI architecture
7. Performance-conscious system design
